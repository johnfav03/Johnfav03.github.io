                    <p> I began my kickboxing journey at the beginning of 2018. I was looking for a fun group exercise to get back in shape because the gym just wasn‚Äôt cutting it. I have been a dancer since I was 3 years old. When I reached the 9th grade, I joined my high school dance team that competed locally and nationally against teams from all over the world. After high school, I took over and became the new coach of the dance team! Coaching has brought me great joy as it allows me to teach students new things, and watch them grow. As you know, I have brought this same attitude to our studio. From a dance team coach to a kickboxing instructor, I have always been extremely dedicated to reaching my goals and helping others reach theirs. I have been instructing since April 2019. In that time, I have not only been able to motivate our members during every class I teach, but I have also helped many create a healthier lifestyle as a whole. One of my main goals is to have each member walk out of class feeling accomplished and confident. I will help guide you through the best hour of your day, and help you CRUSH your goals! So come in and meet me on the mat!</p>

                    <p> Working out and exercising has always been a part of my life. I started out as a gymnast at the age of four and started competing at the age of seven until I graduated from high school. At Albion College, I continued my fitness journey and learning to become an educator of exercise by cheering for the college and becoming a student athletic trainer. I went on to get my certification in Athletic Training and a Masters in Physical Therapy at Central Michigan University. Since graduating, I have been a physical therapist for Beaumont Hospital, specializing in oncology rehabilitation and lymphedema. I enjoy educating others on how to exercise with proper form and assisting patients overcome their injuries with exercise. I started at TKO about two years ago because I enjoyed punching and kicking a bag. It must have been divine intervention that after 20 plus years of coaching high school gymnastics, I was finally ready to retire from coaching that John Clement approached me about becoming an instructor at TKO. I thought this was a great way to transition from coaching. I love being an instructor because I want to motivate others to work hard, stay healthy with group type of fitness and empower others. </p>

I knew if I didn‚Äôt make a change I was going to be that grandma sitting on the bench. Because of  Boxing and lifestyle change I‚Äôm the grandma running around for hours.

                    <p>I have been boxing since I was 13 and have competed at the amateur level. For years I have studied boxing/martial arts. My training focuses on the science behind boxing, ensuring that members leave each session with a better grasp of technique and form. I also value boxing for its health benefits, both physical and mental. Whether members want to stay in shape or reduce stress, boxing can help immensely. I joined TKO because of the supportive community here and I'm excited for you to join the crew!</p>

                    <p>I have been a kickboxing instructor for just over 2 years after being a member for about 4 months. I became an instructor because I fell in love with the workout and wanted to help other people achieve their fitness goals. When I‚Äôm not on the mat you can find me pursuing my other passions--Real Estate and spending time with my Mini Aussie, Stella. I‚Äôve been a manager at a RE/MAX office for 5 years now and have recently become licensed. I have such a passion for the real estate industry and it is honestly like nothing I‚Äôve ever done before. There‚Äôs so much behind the scenes that I fell in love with. My Stella girl is 9 months old and has been my best friend since day 1 (I am sure you‚Äôve seen her in some of my videos). We take lots of walks (even when it‚Äôs cold) and work on learning all sorts of new tricks. I‚Äôm honestly kind of a crazy person because I‚Äôm always on the go with something! I work 7 days a week, attend training classes for Stella, and try to keep up with my workouts as well. I‚Äôm so blessed to work with such an incredible team and I truly love what I do. It‚Äôs been an amazing journey so far and I can‚Äôt wait to see where this all takes me next. I‚Äôll see you all on the mat soon killing those goals! üí™üèº</p>
